The characters in this story is a lion, who is very weak from not being able to hunt for food, a fly, who will help that lion become strong again, and a goat that will be introduced later on who will help the other two characters.

There was once a lion who was very weak from not eating, as all of the animals had moved out in fear of him. He decided to roam the forest in search of food, until he met a fly. The fly askid why he was so weak, and the lion responded that there was no more food in this forest. The fly then told the lion of this place that he had heard of where there was so much meat that it was unimaginable. The two animals started their friendship that would last till they died. They made their way through the treacherous rainforests and deserts and whatnot until they came to a stop at the foot of a mountain. They tried and tried but could never find a way through. In the end, they both decided that it wasn't possible to go any further until a goat asked why they were so sad.
